Intrusion Detection with Python based on Pyshark and Research at the University of Amsterdam

The modbus simulation environment is based on the virtuaplant/oil-refinery project.

Several improvements have been added in my fork of the project.

The ids is based on the pyshark dissector, that is based on tshark and using the wireshark packet dissector and layer structure.
